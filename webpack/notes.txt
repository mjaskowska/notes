## What does it do?

- bundles code/assets together
- manages dependencies

-----------------------------------------------------
## How to set up?

init:
set up package.json: npm init -y
add to .gitignore: node-modules and dist
in package.json:

devDependencies: {
webpack: latestVversion
webpack-cli: latestVersion

scripts: {"start": "webpack  --config webpack.config.js"}

add script tag of the newly created ./dist/main.js (or different) to index.html script tags


-----------------------------------------------------
## create content and export/import it

index.js should be the main file to start with for webpack

import all the main components to enable the code to run
call "run" function

to start: npm start (declared command in package.json)


-----------------------------------------------------
## config webpack:

set up config file


create new file: webpack.config.js  ** it's here where you add all plugins

const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  mode: "development",  **that mode stops the minifiying exported code, change it for production
  
  entry: "./index.js", (or different main js file)
  output: {
  filename: "main.js" (the name of the file with "exported" code)
  path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist") **(path of main.js)
  },
}


-----------------------------------------------------
## Handling loaders and CSS/SASS

loaders are packages that we install and they dictate how certain files should be pre-processed as they're loaded or imported
different way of handling different type files

style-loader, css-loader, sass-loader etc etc

CSS LOADER

to set up this loader 
grab code from "webpack.config.js" section from webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader
paste it into config file

plus run in terminal:  npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader
